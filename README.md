# Food Recipe Web-App
## [Click For DEMO](https://react-graphql-apollo-recipes.herokuapp.com/)

---

## Main Features:
- Full Authentication (sign up, sign in, sign out), 
- able to create, browse, search for, save, and delete recipes,
- React and GraphQL (Apollo Boost) in Frontend, 
- Express, and MongoDB in the Backend.

---

### What I learned from this project:
1. Building a backend with Node.js using the Express framework, then integrate our backend with GraphQL,

2. learn essential topics within GraphQL such as queries, mutations, schemas and resolvers,

3. the GraphQL syntax and work extensively with GraphiQL to test queries and mutations, 

4. build a React application and then connect it to the GraphQL-Express backend using Apollo Boost, and ApolloClient,

5. learn latest features of Apollo Boost and React Apollo, including ApolloClient, ApolloProvider/ApolloConsumer, as well as Query and Mutation components,

6. learn how to refetch queries, use optimistic UI, nest query and mutation components, use fragments,

7. Use React Router (version 4) to provide routing for the application, learn how to make protected routes, 

8. use essential lifecycle methods, reinforce proper state management practices, 

9. use helpful ES6 features such as the object and array spread operators and object and array destructuring,

10. learn additional React component libraries (i.e. react-pose, react-spinners) to style and animate the application,

11. and make application responsive with CSS grid,

12. create a postbuild script and deploying to Heroku, using the Heroku CLI.
